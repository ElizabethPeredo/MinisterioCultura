# The 4 Types of Conditionals

## Zero Conditional

### If + present simple, … present simple.

Used when the result will always happen.

### Example:

*   If water reaches 100 degrees, it boils.
*   If babies are hungry, they cry.
*   People die, if they don’t eat.

## First Conditional

### If + present simple, … will + inﬁnitive.

Used to talk about things that might happen in the future.

### Example:

*   If he comes, I will be surprised.
*   If it rains, I won’t go to the park.
*   We will be late, if we don’t leave soon.

## Second Conditional

### If + past simple, ...would +inﬁnitive

Used to talk about things in the future, that are very unlikely to happen.

Used to talk about something in the present that is impossible.

### Example:

*   If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world.
*   If I were you, I wouldn’t take that job.
*   I would be sad, if we weren’t friends.

## Third Conditional

### If + past perfect, ...would + have + past participle

Used to talk about a situation in the past that didn’t happen and to imagine the result of that situation.

### Example:

*   If she had studied, she would have passed the exam.
*   If we had taken a taxi, we wouldn’t have missed the plane.
*   She would have become a doctor, if she had gone to the university.

## Collective Nouns

*   The jury haven’t yet made a decision. (Plural)

(we can use the verb in singular or plural because jury represent a group of people)

## Quantities and Amounts

*   3 minutes is perfect for dinner. (we use is because 3 is representing one minutes of time)
*   There are 60 minutes in an hour. (we use are when we want to be specific that there are 60 minutes individual)

# Subject Verb Agreement: Part 3

<div class="jelig-grid col-2 med-col-1">

<div class="jelig-card item">

### And

*   The man and woman are walking in the park. (we use “are” when we have to singular nouns together as a group)
*   Fish and chips is the best meal ever! (we use “is” because we have two singular announced, but they form one unit)


<div class="jelig-card item">

### Either/Or

*   Pens or pencils are ok for the exam. (pens and pencils are both the plural for this we use the verb in plural)
*   Pen or pencil is ok for the exam. (pen and pencil are both singular and the verb will be in the singular as well)
*   Either the dogs or the cat goes. (cat is singular and it’s closest to the verb so the verb will also be in singular)


<div class="jelig-card item">

### Neither/Nor

*   Neither the cat nor the dogs go. (dogs is in plural so the verb is also in plural)
*   Neither I nor my friend have stolen anything. (friend is in plural, so the verb is in plural as well)


<div class="jelig-card item">

### Noun/Verb Separation

*   The slice of bread has butter on it. (slice is separated from the verb, but we can see that the slice is singular, so the verb is singular)
*   The glass of water has a ﬂy in it.
*   The houses down the road are cheap.



## Agreement with Cleft Sentences

### What really makes me angry is people who throw rubbish on the ground.

(the verb can agree, either with the beginning of the cleft sentence or the complement. We have to focus on the beginning of the sentence, that’s where our emphasis is)

### What really makes me angry are people who throw rubbish on the ground.

(if the emphasis is the complement, we have to use the verb in plural)


# Inversions: Part 1

![](../assets/img//english/img76.jpg)

## How to invert sentences:

*   I had never eaten something so delicious.
*   Never had I eaten something so delicious.

*   I hardly ever take the subway to work.
*   Hardly ever do I take the subway to work.

*   He doesn’t often help out at home.
*   Not often does he help out at home.

*   You should not leave this room for any reason.
*   Under no circumstances should you leave this room.

### Not + time (until, before, since) + clause

### Only + time (when, as, after, while, once) + clause

*   Not since Hawaii had they seen such beautiful landscapes.
*   Only after the exam did they realize they should have studied more.
*   Little did he know that I would be leaving soon forever.
*   Hardly had I stepped through the door when the dog started barking.

## What is an inversion with a negative adverbial?

In formal English we can place a negative or restrictive adverb at the beginning of a sentence to make the sentence more emphatic or dramatic. When we do this, the adverb is then followed by an inversion:

### auxiliary verb + subject (+ verb)

*   I could find my keys nowhere. ⇒ Nowhere could I find my keys.

When there is no auxiliary verb, we use do/does (present) or did (past) as auxiliary.

*   I understand the true meaning only now. ⇒ Only now do I understand the true meaning.
*   I didn’t say anything until she arrived. ⇒ Not until she arrived did I say anything.


# Inversions: Part 2

*   If I were a hero I would be able to fly
*   Were I a hero I would be able to fly.

*   If I had stayed longer, I would have eaten dessert.
*   Had I stayed longer I would have eaten dessert.

*   If you (should) go to the store, will you get me a dessert?
*   Should you go to the store, will you get me a dessert?

*   The spy came through the window.
*   Through the window came the spy.

*   My book was here.
*   Here was my book.

*   My father/He sat there.
*   There sat my father.
*   There he sat.

### so + adjective + inversion + that + consequence

### such + noun + inversion + that + consequence

*   So beautiful was she that I couldn’t stop staring at her.
*   Such a well-behaved dog that I didn’t even know it was there.

## Example Response:

Dear John,

Due to the current crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many of our departments and their sales have been affected and they have shown a drastic decline in their finances. This critical situation has led us to evaluate other strategies and rethink our business model as well as to evaluate other possible scenarios and solutions to keep our revenues profitable.

For this reason, I would like to arrange with you and the rest of the members of our team a special meeting where we could discuss the impact of this crisis on our sales. Furthermore, we could talk about possible solutions or strategies, in order to reduce the impact of this crisis on our business. For example, the implementation of new deals or promotions, discuss ideas about how we can position our brand, renovate our marketing strategy or even evaluate the introduction of new products using our own infrastructure to produce them.

In summary, the idea behind this meeting is to discuss a new business strategy and look for different sustainable solutions in order to avoid negative consequences.

Could you please let me know when this meeting would be convenient for you? I look forward to hearing from you promptly.

Sincerely,

Jenna Vander Brook
