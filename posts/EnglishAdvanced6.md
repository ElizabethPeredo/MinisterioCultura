## Module: soft skills

### Exploring soft skills:

*   Communication (listening, conﬁdence, conﬂict resolution, organization)
*   Creativity (learning from others, open-mindedness, risk-taking)
*   Adaptability (consistency, optimism, ﬂexibility)
*   Work Ethic (integrity, time-management, persistence)
*   Teamwork (empathy, critical thinking, leadership, commitment, reliability)

>Creativity involves learning from others, which also involves listening.

## Know yourself

[https://www.16personalities.com/](https://www.16personalities.com/)

<cite>It is not the strongest or most intelligent who will survive, but those who can best manage change.</cite> **(Charles Darwin)**

## What are soft skills?

[https://virtualspeech.com/blog/importance-soft-skills](https://virtualspeech.com/blog/importance-soft-skills)

Soft skills are personal attributes that influence how well you can work or interact with others. These skills make it easier to form relationships with people, create trust and dependability, and lead teams.

In essence, they are essential for your success in the workplace, your company’s success and your personal life.

Most interactions with other people require some level of soft skills. At a company you might be negotiating to win a new contract, presenting your new idea to colleagues, networking for a new job, and so on. We use soft skills everyday at work and developing these soft skills will help you win more business and accelerate your career progression.

On the other hand, a lack of soft skills can limit your potential, or even be the downfall of your business. By developing strong leadership, delegation, teamwork, and communication abilities, you can run projects more smoothly, deliver results that please everyone, and even positively influence your personal life by improving how you interact with others.

# Effective communication - Effective listening

COMMUNICATION: Is the act of transferring information from one person, place or group to a receiver.

![](../assets/img/english/img83.jpg)

## Effective listening

<cite>Most people don’t listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.</cite> **(Stephen R. Covey, the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People)**

## To be a good listener

*   Don’t think about what you are going to say while the other person is talking.
*   Don’t speak about what you do not know.
*   Don’t speak from your own autobiography.
*   Don’t brag.
*   Don’t repeat yourself.
*   Don’t give unnecessary details.

### To be a good listener, do:

*   Be authentic.
*   Be in the moment.
*   Accept opinions different from your own.
*   Ask open-ended questions.
*   Go with the flow.
*   Think about the other person first.
*   Be empathetic.
*   When you do speak, be brief.

# Confidence

## Be prepared

*   Acknowledge that you don’t know everything.
*   There is always room for learning. If it doesn’t come natural, you can always improve.
*   Practice makes perfect.
*   Look at the most difficult tasks for you, and tackle them first.
*   Do research on the subject.

I’m learning, I’m human and if I make a mistake, I admit and I move on.

## Get into the right mindset

*   You are where you are for a reason.
*   We all bring a fresh perspective to every issue.
*   Nobody is an expert at everything, everybody knows something others don’t.
*   Focus on what you are giving more than on your insecurities.
*   Get to a point where you enjoy what you are doing.

<cite>Confidence equals security equals positive emotion equals better performance</cite> **(Tony Schwartz)**

# Conflict resolution

Conflict is impossible to avoid. We cannot lead a life without conflict in a work situation, a person who can deal with conflict successfully is a very valuable member of the team.

## The upside of conflict:

*   It is a symptom of creativity in a team.
*   It generates innovation.
*   It makes a team more productive and less conformist.
*   It helps find current weaknesses in the organization.

Whenever you don't have any conflict, something is not going well, because everyone has different ideas. Conflict helps us look at the weaknesses in our organization and improve the organization.

## Ground rules:

*   Choose a neutral place for dialogue.
*   Do not generalize.
*   Avoid taking it personal.
*   Stay with the current issue.
*   Listen, do not interrupt.
*   Keep in mind the well-being of everyone.
*   Look for common ground.
*   Do not coerce.

<div class="card note">

Dialogue is very important, it makes lights come in.

Not coerce: You cannot force a person to accept your ideas.

<cite>The quality of our lives depends not on whether or not we have conﬂicts, but on how we respond to them.</cite> **(Thomas Crum)**

*   I you have a lot of ideas, but you don’t do anything with them that means you have an imagination.
*   Creativity means having ideas and turning them into something new.

<cite>Inspiration comes during work, not before it.</cite> **(Margaret L’Engle )**

## Score as creative geniuses:

![](../assets/img/english/img84.jpg)

<cite>A creative adult is the child who survived.</cite> **(Ursula LeGuine )**

Maybe society has been designed to make people less creative. Parents generate that the kids lose their creativity, because they are terrified of their little explorers and refrain kids from investigating and from bringing dirt and treasures back into the home. Another culprit is school system, this was develop during the industrial revolution and it had the objective of, promoting people who would follow rules and repeat the same behavior.

# Competition vs Cooperation

<cite>Competition is the law of the jungle, but cooperation is the law of civilization.</cite> **(Peter Kropotkin )**

![](../assets/img/english/img87.jpg)

## Competition

Generates challenge and growth, it motivates us get out of our comfort zone and reach for more, thus boosting creativity.

In excess, it may make us lose focus and demotivate us.

One absolute winner would lead to mediocrity.

## Cooperation:

Helps distribute success and, in the case of collaboration among companies, generates a distribution of wealth.

# Presentations

<cite>Successful presentations are understandable, memorable and emotional.</cite> **(Carmine Gallo )**

## Presentation objectives:

*   To inform
*   To instruct
*   To persuade
*   To aid decision making
*   To motivate

## Presentation

*   Visual presentations
*   Short verbal presentations
*   Educational presentations
*   Coaching
*   Story-telling
*   Synergetic presentations

## WHY ARE PRESENTATIONS DIFFICULT FOR MANY OF US?

Now, if we are perfectly honest, we must admit that we don’t love to stand up and speak in public. The reason for this may be that it involves standing in front of a group of people talking about a subject as if we were experts. Interestingly, even if we are, in fact, experts, the moment we have to stand in front of a group, many of us lose our aplomb.

Another reason why we do not enjoy this kind of activity is that we know people will not necessarily be listening to us one hundred percent of the time. It is difficult to catch a listener’s attention and even more difficult to hold it for a number of minutes.

A third reason why we don’t love speaking in public is that we are afraid that we will mess up.

So, how do we deal with this situation? After all, giving presentations is a common activity and it may even be an extremely interesting and desirable part of our professional life

### Visual presentations.

A great number of people are visual learners. This is the reason most presenters opt for visual support when giving a presentation. The problem with this style of public speaking is that some speakers prepare a very complete powerpoint presentation and then they devote their time to reciting the exact information that they are showing their audience. This turns a presentation redundant and makes the audience wish they had received all this information via email instead. If you decide to rely on visuals for your presentation, make them brief, relevant and entertaining.

### Short verbal presentations.

This kind of speech is also known as an elevator pitch because it is supposed to be short enough to fit into an elevator trip. It is more commonly used as a sales pitch. It is brief, clear and to the point.

### Educational presentations.

Most presentations should teach something to the audience. We must be careful, however, not to fall into the trap of preaching or lecturing. If we want our audience to learn, they must first stay awake and tuned in with what we are trying to say.

### Coaching

These presentations have the goal of awakening and inspiring our audience. They are first and foremost about making contact and exciting people and moving them into action.

### Story-telling

A very effective way to capture our audience’s attention is to tell them anecdotes. Once again, we must remember that if we do not know our audience, we will not know exactly the kind of stories that will be meaningful to them.

### Synergetic presentations

When instead of lecturing for ten minutes, we decide to ask questions and allow our audience to answer, we are sure to have their attention.These presentations tend to work very well because they keep the audience active and involved.

## Points to remember

### Attention span

Most people do not pay attention longer than three minutes. Sometimes not even that. Try to make your presentation brief and varied. This does not mean you cannot speak for longer than three minutes, but you need to change your pace and vary your tone of voice. Sensing our audience and adapting to their reactions is also important.

### Preparation

Remember, the more you research and practice, the better you will feel about the topic you are presenting. Once you feel self-confident about the subject matter, you will be able to enjoy what you are doing.

### Simplicity

Do not over prepare either. If you try to create a super production, you will get lost in the details and will end up losing your audience. Don’t forget that it should not be about showing off. It should be about people getting the message and learning something from your words.
