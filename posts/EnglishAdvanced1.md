## Participles in Verb Phrases

A verb can have as many as four parts. When you form a multipart verb—a verb phrase—you use a combination of auxiliary verbs and participles.

*   Our pet alligator ate Mrs. Olsen's poodle.

*   Ate = simple past tense (no participle).

*   When we arrived, Mrs. Olsen was beating our alligator over the head with a broom.

*   Was = auxiliary verb; beating = present participle.

*   Our pet alligator has been stalking neighborhood pets because my brother Billy forgets to feed the poor reptile.

*   Has = auxiliary verb; been = past participle; stalking = present participle.

## Participles as Adjectives

Past and present participles often function as adjectives that describe nouns.

*   The crying baby drew a deep breath and sucked in a spider crouching in the corner of the crib.

*   Which baby? The crying baby. Which spider? The one that was crouching in the corner.

*   The mangled pair of sunglasses, bruised face, broken arm, and bleeding knees meant Genette had taken another spill on her mountain bike.

*   Which pair of sunglasses? The mangled pair. Which face? The bruised one. Which arm? The broken one. Which knees? The bleeding ones.

## Participles as Nouns

Present participles can function as nouns—the subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, objects of prepositions, and subject complements in sentences. Whenever a present participle functions as a noun, you call it a gerund.

*   Sneezing exhausts Steve, who requires eight tissues and twenty-seven Gesundheits before he is done.

*   Sneezing = subject of the action verb exhausts.

*   Valerie hates cooking because scraping burnt gunk out of pans always undermines her enjoyment of the food.

*   Cooking = direct object of the action verb hates.

*   We gave bungee jumping a chance.

*   Bungee jumping = indirect object of the action verb gave.

*   Joelle bit her tongue instead of criticizing her prom date's powder blue tuxedo.

*   Criticizing = object of the preposition instead of.

# Gerund vs. inﬁnitive ING vs. TO

In English when we want to introduce an action or a verb after certain words or, we can either follow it with a form of the verb with ING or TO. In which cases do we use one or the other?

## Gerund clause or phrase

It is a phrase composed of a gerund (ing) and any other typical components. In this type of sentences, the gerund acts as a noun and it can work as a subject or an object.

# Expressing certainty

What happens when you see an action in the present, and you try to imagine what could have happened in the past. How to create explanations or hypothesis for the situations that we see in the present.

## Construction

In order to create a hypothesis about some event in the past, you can rely on the combination of a modal verb, have and a past participle:

*   He looks tired. He must have stayed up all night.

## Degrees of certainty

### Must:

*   Very certain
*   She got a great score on the test, she must have studied a lot.
*   He plays guitar very well, he must have taken classes.

### May/might/could:

*   Not sure.
*   She hasn’t arrived yet, she might have had some extra work to do.
*   He didn’t call for my birthday, he may have forgotten about it.

### Can’t:

*   Sure it didn’t happen.
*   You can’t have seen my mom, she is not in town.
*   She can’t have liked pizza, she is allergic.

## Modals of Possibility and Probability for Past Situations

### Affirmative

### MODAL + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE (to show how certain the speaker is that something happened)

Must have + past participle shows a great deal of certainty that something happened, but there is still some doubt in the speaker’s mind. He/she is not 100% certain. For example:

*   The students did well on the test. They must have studied hard.

*   (There are other possible reasons why the students did well on the test. It might have been very easy, or they might have already learned the material. The speaker uses must have studied hard to show that he/she thinks this is the most logical reason they did so well.)

*   I’ve phoned Jim several times, but he doesn’t answer. He must have gone out.

*   (The speaker believes this is the most logical reason why Jim doesn’t answer the phone. However, other reasons are possible. He might not have heard the phone, or he might not have wanted to talk to anyone.)

May, might and could convey the idea that a speaker is only 50% or less certain that something happened. The use of could implies a little more certainty. For example:

*   My wife doesn’t answer the phone. She may (might, could) have gone shopping.

*   (The speaker doesn’t know for sure that his wife went shopping. However, it is his best guess.)

### Negative

### MODAL + NOT + BASE VERB + PAST PARTICIPLE (to show how certain the speaker is that something didn’t happen)

Can’t or couldn’t have + past participle shows that the speaker is very certain something didn’t happen. For example:

*   Robin looks tired today. She can’t have slept well last night.

*   (This is the speaker’s best guess as to why Robin looks tired. Of course, other reasons are possible. For instance, she might be ill.)

May or might not have + past participle shows that the speaker is 50% or less certain that something didn’t happen. For example:

*   There was a strange light in the sky yesterday evening. I don’t know for sure what it was, but I may have seen a U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Object).

An appropriate modal + have is used in most short answers. However, if the question has a be verb, the formula for responding is appropriate modal + have been. For example:

*   Person A: Has Jennifer decided which courses she’s going to take next semester?
*   Person B: I’m not sure. She might have.
*   Person C: Do you think Tim enjoyed the concert?
*   Person D: I don’t know. He may have.

# Conditional and judgement

Judgement: The ability to form valuable opinions and make good decisions:

*   I don't think you have the right to pass judgment (on others) (= to say whether you think other people are good or bad).

## If I had...

### If I had ….., + possible result

Whenever you start a condition with if, you need a comma after the condition

## Examples:

*   If you had studied harder, You would have passed the exam.
*   If he had read the book, He could have answered all the questions.
*   You would have traveled more if you had saved money.
*   You could have been a great football player if you had trained harder.

## When we judge past actions we use:

### should (n’t) have

We use should (n’t) have when we give an opinion or judgement about a past situation:

*   Jessica: I didn´t study for the exam.
*   Me: You should’ve studied. It was 50 points.
*   I´m judging Jessica because she didn’t study.

## When suggesting alternative past actions we use:

### could (n’t) have & would (n’t) have

We use would (n’t) have when we are imagining a hypothetical situation happening to us and doing something different:

*   Jessica: I forgave my boyfriend.
*   Me: I wouldn´t have forgiven him.
*   =If I were Jessica, I wouldn’t have forgiven him.

We use could (n’t) have when we are suggesting a hypothetical past possibility:

*   Jessica: My boyfriend was sad and I didn´t ask him why.
*   Me: You could have shown more empathy.
*   =You had the chance to show empathy but You didn´t.

# Expectations and traditions

## Be + expected / supposed + to

We use this construction to emphasize intention in something to happen.

*   When you study, you are expected to learn a lot.
*   Her vacations are over, she is supposed to arrive tomorrow.
*   Our best friends are getting married, we are expected to go to their wedding.

## You are not supposed to / You are not expected to

Expected in the negative sense means it is not necessary to do something.

*   You are not expected to dress formal in a stadium.

Supposed in negative sense means you shouldn’t do something.

*   You are not supposed to eat in the library.

## It is accustomed to

Accustomed to implies that an action is normal or traditional.

*   During Christmas it is accustomed to eat lots of food.
*   She works for an airline, she is accustomed to spend a lot of time without seeing her family.

<div class="card note">

*   When you "suppose" you think that something is true, but not the one that we’re going to use.
*   When you use “to be supposed to” means that you have the intention to do something.

*   You’re expected to buy some gifts for your family.

</div>

## Suppose vs. Supposed—Is There a Difference?

### When to Use Supposed To

To be supposed to is a common phrase that functions the same way a modal verb does. Modal verbs, also called auxiliary or helping verbs, add meaning to the main verb in a sentence by expressing possibility, ability, permission, or obligation. Supposed to, like have to, can fall into the “obligation” category.

*   I have to be home by midnight or my coach will turn into a pumpkin.
*   I am supposed to be home by midnight or my coach will turn into a pumpkin.

It can also be used to indicate what a person (or thing) is likely to do or is reputed to do.

*   It was supposed to rain today.
*   She is supposed to be the best poodle breeder in town.

Whenever it is used in either of these senses, supposed to will be preceded by a form of to be and followed by a verb.

*   He is supposed to turn in his homework on Friday mornings.
*   Were we supposed to be here so early?

### The Verb To Suppose

On the other hand, the verb to suppose means to presume, in theory, that something is the case without certain evidence.

*   Max isn’t here yet, so I suppose his train was delayed.
*   The committee supposes that the decline in profits is due to a faulty product design.

As an imperative, it can mean the equivalent of what would happen if.

*   Suppose my coach really does turn into a pumpkin. What will I do then?

## Supposed To, Have To, and Ought To

To be supposed to do something implies that the subject is obligated and expected to do the main verb’s action, although there is a possibility it won’t happen.

*   The magician is supposed to pull a rabbit out of his hat.
*   Here, there is an expectation that the magician will be able to perform his trick correctly, but there is always a chance that he won’t succeed. The sentence conveys this expectation and the reader must now wait to see if that expectation will be fulfilled.

Has to means the same as must; it implies that the subject has no choice about performing the verb’s action.

*   The magician has to produce the rabbit to earn applause.
*   This sentence conveys that if the magician does not produce the rabbit, there will be no applause. He simply must do it to get the result he wants.

Ought to is more of a suggestion. It conveys what would be best for the subject to do, but the subject is not compelled to do it.

*   The magician ought to slip his rabbit a carrot before the show.
*   To ensure that he has a compliant, content rabbit in his hat, the magician should give his rabbit a carrot, although no one requires it of him. It would simply be a good idea.

# Deﬁning relative clauses

## Explanation:

A relative clause is a phrase connected by a relative pronoun (That, Who, What, Where, Whose, Which) depending on the function, it can be deﬁning or non deﬁning.

## Construction of Deﬁning relative clauses

*   This is the park where I used to come when I was younger.
*   They need a person who is capable of working under pressure.
*   This is the object that they use to record high quality sound.

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Subject or object</th>

<th>No relative pronoun</th>

<th>Nouns and pronouns in relative clauses</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

The relative pronoun can define the subject or the object of the verb:

*   They’re the people who/that bought our house. (The people bought our house. The people is the subject.)*   They’re the people who/that she met at Jon’s party. (She met the people. The people is the object.)*   Here are some cells which/that show abnormality. (Some cells show abnormality. Some cells is the subject.)*   Here are some cells which/that the researcher has identified. (The researcher has identified some cells. Some cells is the object.)</td>

<td>

We often leave out the relative pronoun when it is the object of the verb:

*   They’re the people she met at Jon’s party.*   Here are some cells the researcher has identified.</td>

<td>

When the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, we don’t use another personal pronoun or noun in the relative clause because the subject (underlined) is the same:

*   She’s the lady who lent me her phone. (who is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun she)*   Not: She’s the lady who she lent me her phone.*   There are now only two schools in the area that actually teach Latin. (that is the subject of the relative clause, so we don’t need the personal pronoun they)*   Not: There are now only two schools in the area that they actually teach Latin.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

# Non deﬁning relative clauses

## Explanation:

Non deﬁning relative clauses are sentences that use a relative pronoun and that are not necessary in order to identify who or what we are talking about. They just provide extra information (It’s not important and the commas work as a parenthesis).

## Construction of ND relative clauses

In ND relative clauses the information provided by them is not essential to the structure or the meaning of the whole sentence.

*   My mom, who lives in an apartment, works every day.
*   The national park, where a lot of historical artifacts are kept, is located downtown.

# Relative clauses for comments

## Explanation:

It is not only possible to specify or give extra information about single nouns. We can make comments or add opinions about full sentences.

## Which as relative pronoun

*   In this case, which will help us introduce a comment about a full sentence or idea instead of a single noun.
*   I have two jobs, which means I am very tired at the end of the day.
*   She woke up very early today, which is why she fell asleep so suddenly.

## Relative pronouns, who, whom, whose, which, that

Who and whom are used mainly for people. However, these pronouns can also be used to refer to animals that are mentioned by name and seen as persons.

*   The musician who wrote this song is Canadian.
*   The witnesses whom I interviewed gave conflicting evidence.
*   The vacuum scared our cat Scooter, who was sleeping on the rug.

Whose can be used for people, animals or things:

*   The man whose daughter won the tournament is a tennis coach.
*   A dog whose owner lets it run loose may cause an accident.
*   The tree whose branches shade my kitchen window is an oak.

Which is used for animals in general or things.

*   Bridget visited the park with her dog, which likes to chase squirrels.
*   Jason bought the top hybrid car, which will help him save on gas.

That can be used for people, animals or things.

*   The musician that won the award is Canadian.
*   The car that Jason bought runs on electricity and gas.
*   The dog that is chasing the squirrels belongs to Bridget.

## That vs. which

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Essential clauses</th>

<th>Non-essential clauses</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

That always indicates a clause that is essential to the meaning of the sentence because it defines or identifies the noun it refers to. An essential clause does not take a comma before it.

*   Lisa wore the shoes that she bought in Italy.
*   (What shoes? The ones that she bought in Italy. The clause identifies the shoes.)

Which may also be used to introduce an essential clause.

*   Lisa wore the shoes which she bought in Italy.

</td>

<td>

Which is used in a non-essential clause modifying an animal or a thing. A non-essential clause is one that gives secondary, non-essential information about a noun that is already fully identified. A non-essential clause is separated from its noun with a comma:

*   Lisa wore her best leather shoes, which she bought in Italy.
*   (What shoes? Her best leather ones. The clause is not needed to identify the shoes, so it is non-essential.)

</td>

## Who vs. whom

The relative pronoun who may cause confusion because it has both a subject form (who) and an object form (whom). The key to choosing between these forms is to see what the pronoun is doing in its own clause.

Use who if the pronoun is the subject of the verb in the dependent clause.

*   The people who just boarded the plane are in a rock band.
*   (The pronoun is subject of the verb boarded.)

Use whom if the pronoun is the object of the verb in the dependent clause.

*   The cousin whom we met at the family reunion is coming to visit.
*   (The pronoun is object of the verb met.)

Use whom if the pronoun is the object of a preposition in the dependent clause.

*   The agent with whom I spoke was able to help me.
*   (The pronoun is object of the preposition with.)

<div class="card note">

If in doubt, reword the clause to see which personal pronoun you need: he/him, she/her, etc. Then replace that pronoun with who or whom, using the following rule:

</div>
*   Use WHO for he, she, they, we:

*   The people who just boarded the plane are in a rock band.

*   (Reword: They just boarded the plane—so use who.)

*   Use WHOM for him, her, them, us:

*   The cousin whom we met at the family reunion is coming to visit.

*   (Reword: We met him at the family reunion—so use whom.)

*   The agent with whom I spoke was able to help me.

*   (Reword: I spoke with her—so use whom.)

# General truths

## Construction zero conditional

### Explanation:

We use the ﬁrst type of conditional to express situations that are the typical result of standard conditions.

*   If you put water in the freezer, it freezes.

### If present + Present

*   If I don’t know something, I look for it on google.
*   I wear something light if the weather is hot.
*   I ask for directions if I don’t know the place.
*   If I have an exam, I study the day before

# Unreal present

## Construction of type 2 conditionals

### Explanation:

We use this type of conditional to create a hypothetical result in the present based on an unlikely event.

*   If the weather were better, I could ride my bike.

### If + Simple past, Would/Could

*   If I had more money, I wouldn’t work.
*   If she worked harder, She could get a promotion.
*   He wouldn’t be so tired if he worked out more.
*   I could play basketball if I were taller.
*   For the verb TO BE in the if clause, we will always use WERE.

# Unreal past

## Construction of type 3 conditionals

### Explanation:

This type of conditionals make reference to hypothetical conditions in the past that could have effects also in the past. This is called type 3 conditional or unreal conditional because it is impossible to change the result of those situations in the past.

### If + Past perfect, would / could + have past participle

*   If I had saved more money,
*   She would have taken English classes if she had had more time.

# Modal requests

## Possibilities

In order to make requests there are many options and each of them vary depending of the degree of formality.

*   Can you help me?
*   Could she use the restroom?
*   Is it ok if my sister comes with me?
*   Would it be ok if I arrive 5 minutes late?
*   Would you mind explaining the topic again?
*   I was wondering if you could go to the party with me.

Less formal

*   Can
*   Could
*   Is it ok if

More formal

*   Would it be ok if
*   Would you mind
*   I was wondering if

## Modals of Polite Request: Would you, Could you, Will you, Can you

Modal verbs are helping/auxiliary verbs that express ideas like ability, permission, and asking for assistance. Many modal verbs have more than one meaning. They are always followed by the simple form of a verb.

*   Could you help me for a minute, please?
*   This shows that the speaker is asking for help politely.

To ask questions in a very polite way, use: Would you/ Could you (please) + simple verb + ...?

*   Would you please email that document to me? I need it ASAP*.
*   Could you explain that again, please? I didn’t understand.

*ASAP = as soon as possible

To ask questions in a polite but more casual way, say: Will you/ Can you (please) + simple verb + ...?

*   Will you please answer the phone? I’m working.
*   Can you hold my books for me? My hands are full.

We do not use the word “may” in a polite question when “you” is the subject.

*   May you please close the door? Wrong!
*   Could you please close the door? Right!

The word “please” makes the request more polite and less direct. Canadians use “please” often and visitors are expected to ask for help politely, using “please.”

# Complex and simple indirect questions

## Explanation:

Indirect questions are camouﬂaged questions, this means that they don’t have the traditional structure of a question but the purpose is to get an answer. We use this constructions when we ask questions to people we don’t know and want to sound a bit more formal.

## Construction

In order to create an Indirect question we need an introductory phrase:

*   Do you know … ?
*   I wonder / was wondering …
*   Can you tell me …
*   I have no idea ...
*   I'd like to know …

And then we need to introduce the question but in an statement word order, this is, the normal afﬁrmative order.

# Tag and negative questions

## Explanation:

A tag question is a small question that we express at the end of an statement to conﬁrm the information. The negative question is just the same tag but at the beginning of the statement.

# Wish

## Explanation:

One way to talk about the future is through wishes. And whenever you use this verb, there are some special rules you must follow.

*   I wish I had more time.

## Uses of wish

As a rule, everytime you use Wish it has to be followed by a verb in past. You can express desires for the futures as well as the past:

*   I wish my friends spent more time with me.
*   He wishes he had studied more for the test.
*   I wish I were smarter.
*   She wishes she were taller.

## The Verb Wish to Describe a Present Desire

### subject + wish + (that) + noun + past simple / past progressive

*   I wish (that) I had more money now. (this describes a desire the present)
*   She wishes (that) she were taller.
*   He wishes (that) he didn’t have to work today.
*   They wish (that) they could come.
*   I wish (that) it wasn’t raining.

I’ve just told you that we use a past tense verb (past simple or past progressive) after wish. However, we use the helping verb would when we wish that someone else would do an action.

*   I wish you would listen. (It’s my wish, but I want you to do the action.)
*   She wishes her husband wouldn’t leave the toilet seat up. (It’s her wish, but she’s wishing someone else do the action.)
*   I wish the manager would do something. (Again, the wish is directed at someone else.)

We only use would when the verb is an action verb, not a state verb (for help with this, see this lesson). In short, action verbs are verbs like ‘kick/run/open/stop‘ that have an action (we move our bodies). Non-action verbs (stative or linking) are verbs like ‘have/be/know/understand‘ that describe a situation (or state), not an action. Here at some examples.

## Using Wish to Describe a Past Regret or Mistake

### subject + wish + (that) + noun + past perfect*

(*Past perfect = had + past participle)

*   I didn’t study enough when I was young. I wish I had studied more.
*   I didn’t bring an umbrella. I wish I had brought an umbrella.
*   She said something impolite. She wishes she hadn’t said it.
*   My friend forgot my birthday. I wish he hadn’t forgotten.

# Simple Future

## USE 1 "Will" to Express a Voluntary Action

"Will" often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something.

*   I will send you the information when I get it.
*   Will you help me move this heavy table?
*   I won't do all the housework myself!

## USE 2 "Will" to Express a Promise

Will" is usually used in promises.

*   I will call you when I arrive.
*   If I am elected President of the United States, I will make sure everyone has access to inexpensive health insurance.
*   I promise I will not tell him about the surprise party.
*   Don't worry, I'll be careful.
*   I won't tell anyone your secret.

## USE 3 "Be going to" to Express a Plan

"Be going to" expresses that something is a plan. It expresses the idea that a person intends to do something in the future. It does not matter whether the plan is realistic or not.

*   He is going to spend his vacation in Hawaii.
*   A: When are we going to meet each other tonight?
*   B: We are going to meet at 6 PM.
*   I'm going to be an actor when I grow up.
*   Michelle is going to begin medical school next year.
*   They are going to drive all the way to Alaska.
*   Who are you going to invite to the party?

## USE 4 "Will" or "Be Going to" to Express a Prediction

Both "will" and "be going to" can express the idea of a general prediction about the future. Predictions are guesses about what might happen in the future. In "prediction" sentences, the subject usually has little control over the future and therefore USES 1-3 do not apply. In the following examples, there is no difference in meaning.

*   The year 2222 will be a very interesting year.
*   The year 2222 is going to be a very interesting year.
*   John Smith will be the next President.
*   John Smith is going to be the next President.
*   The movie "Zenith" will win several Academy Awards.
*   The movie "Zenith" is going to win several Academy Awards.

# Future perfect

## Explanation

We use this construction to emphasize an action that will be taking place and lasting at a particular point in the future.

### Will + Have + Past participle

Common time expressions: by, within, in etc.

*   By July next year, I will have ﬁnished my course.
*   Within the next two weeks I will have taken around 20 lessons.
*   In 2 years time, she will have graduated from University.

# Future perfect continuous

## Explanation:

Future perfect continuous is used when we specify the duration of an action in the future. Within an speciﬁc span of time.

** We need to emphasize the duration of the moment. We’re going to be dealing with the duration of the action.**

*   Next month I will have been living in this city for a year.

### Will + have + been Present participle (ing)

We can use the same time expressions but we have to emphasize in the duration of the action.

*   By 2025, I will have been living abroad for 2 years.
*   In December, I will have been working in this company for 8 months.
