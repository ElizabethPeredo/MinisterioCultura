## Activity

### Prepare a list of the pros and cons of learning in a University.

### PROS:

1\. You can become an expert in a subject you love

If you’re the person who has to know everything there is to know about a subject, then uni could be for you. Over the three or four years of your undergraduate course, you’ll become an expert in your chosen subject. The chances are you’ll get to choose a number of specialist areas of study as your interests develop.

2\. University can prepare you for a specific career path

Some jobs require a university degree. For example, if you want to be a doctor or a vet, you’ll need to go to university. Other career paths typically start out at university – such as engineering, nursing and laboratory science. However, more and more apprenticeships are opening up – in fact, apprenticeships are available in all three of these professions today. If you’re considering a career in one of these areas, university may still be the best way in, but research all your options before making up your mind.

3\. Graduates earn more

Graduates earn 35% more than school leavers, according to the stats pros at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). And while the gap is narrowing, the IFS say it isn’t going anywhere soon. Don’t forget that the 35% number is a headline – there are lots of factors which can make a difference. These include the course and university you choose and the career path you’d like to pursue.

4\. Uni gives you time to gain work experience

Going to university means you’ll be very highly qualified come graduation day – but it doesn’t guarantee you the technical and employability skills employers look for. Never fear – the long summer vacation is a great time to gain experience and skills through internships, a summer job or work experience placement. Internships are plentiful – but they can be competitive. If you don’t get one, look for local employers related to the career path you’re considering and get in touch.

5\. You’ll get a taste of independence

University gives you a flavour of independent living without throwing you in at the deep end. You’ll usually be broken in gently with a year in halls, giving you the chance to learn basic life skills like cooking and doing the laundry. Later, you’ll probably live in rented accommodation. Choosing a student house is exciting and insightful – and although you might not relish the thought of clean the loo or kitchen sink when you move in, it’s all good experience!

6\. You will gain high-level transferable skills

Uni may be light on workplace experience, but a degree gives you skills that will stand you in good stead throughout your career. Whatever subject you study, you’ll learn to think critically and analytically, question assumption, carry out thorough and robust research, solve problems, and process large amounts of information quickly.

7\. It can broaden your mind

One of the best things about uni is that it can alter your outlook on the world. It's a chance to move to a new place, meet people from different backgrounds, learn about fascinating ideas and experience culture, art and politics. OK, so we may be painting a grand view of uni life, but it's all there for the taking – if you want it.

### CONS:

1\. You may not gain technical skills

Some degrees, such as medicine or veterinary science, prepare you for a particular career path. Others, like engineering and computer science are geared towards certain areas of work. These degree courses give you skills that you can directly apply in your job, should you choose to continue in your field of study. However, many roles are open to graduates with a degree in any discipline – and according to research by the New College of the Humanities, half of graduates end up in jobs like these. Your degree may give you valuable transferable skills, but you will have to learn the technical skills you need to carry out your job.

2\. You may not get employability skills

According to research by Career Builder, only one in three employers thinks students graduate with the skills they need in the workplace. Nearly half of employers surveyed said graduates leave university without people skills, and many said graduates lacked problem-solving, creative thinking, communication and teamwork skills.

3\. Contact time is less than at school

Contact time is often much less than students expect. In a recent survey, nearly two thirds of students thought they would get more contact time than at school, and a similar number expected to spend more time in lectures than in the classroom. In reality, contact time is usually much less than at school. Courses such as history may have less than 10 hours of weekly contact time.

4\. You’ll leave with a lot of debt

According to research by the Sutton Trust, 2015 graduates left university with an average of £44,000 of debt. This is likely to rise as tuition fees and living and accommodation costs increase. The good news is repayments are linked to your earnings – currently, you must be earning around £17,500 to start repaying your student loan, and your remaining loan will be written off if you don’t repay it within 30 years of the first April after you graduate.

5\. You will be committing at least three years of your life

A university degree is a big commitment to academic study. Most bachelor’s degrees last at least three years. You should think carefully if you’d prefer to be working in a paid job than dedicating yourself to years of study, coursework, revision and exams.

6\. You’re not guaranteed a graduate job

Nearly a third of graduates (31%) do not do a graduate job. This does not mean they will never do a graduate job, and with the job market a very competitive place, their degree may still have helped them get that job.

7\. Lifetime earnings can be higher with an apprenticeship

According to the Sutton Trust, those with a level 5 apprenticeship (or higher) are likely to earn more over their lifetime than graduates with a degree from a non-Russell Group university. Apprentices in this group are predicted to earn an average of £1.5 million over their career, compared with the £1.4 million forecast for non-Russell Group graduates.

## Activity: Share your opinion about education in your country.

[https://www.ukessays.com/essays/education/the-role-of-education-in-a-country-education-essay.php](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/education/the-role-of-education-in-a-country-education-essay.php)

Education means a form of learning in which knowledge, skills and habits are transferred from on generation to the nest generation. The education of a person starts when he born. At the early stage the most important teachers of a child are his parents and specially his mother’s. Because one mothers can teach his child best. As there are three levels of education primary, secondary and tertiary.

One always quickly consider that for the developmental role of education in a country the tertiary level is important, but I think that for better future the bass means start is important and the start of a child’s education is within his mother’s hands. So the nations or countries are by build by mothers, if he teacher child well then it is impossible that country can’t developing.

The education plays a great role in developing country in every field. It plays like a model role in the development of one country if the people of a country are educated then they can easily helps them in development.

In the earlier stages the peoples are talented, so that they invent many ideas and think much more but due to lake of education they can’t prove them much more. At that time they have no laboratories in which they can prove their ideas. But now the world which is developing are used their ideas and thinking. It is due to education that they are developed so that they can prove the thinking of past scientists.

Education is the driving force for the national development and economic growth are very strongly depends on the education and these both are playing great role in developing a country. The nations are build by education economic growth can be increased, if the peoples of a country are educated they can easily grow up the national economy because then they can better knows the economic principles and rules and can think about them easily if they are educated.

Education gives people the skills they need to help themselves out of poverty or, in other words, into prosperity. If one got education then he is able to a better job then a labor’s work. He is ale to do a government job or any other private job and can show their skills which are helpful in developing a country. There is huge difference between an educated and uneducated person, an uneducated can’t show his ideas and skills better than an educated person. He is always beyond the educated one. Hence it is the education which can leads a person from poverty into prosperity.

As we know that the agriculture plays a very important role in the development of a country. The education plays a great role in the field of agriculture. If we gives the education of agriculture to the students then they can perform better in the agriculture field, they can invent the new ideas which improve the rate of agriculture and their quality. Nowadays the nation gives a chances to the student to study about the agriculture which is very good process because if the new talent know the advantages of agriculture in the role of country then they can solve all the problems in the field of agriculture if they study the agriculture. And by this way if the agriculture of a country is healthy then that country can perform better in the competition of advancement in the world. Therefore the education plays a great role in agriculture which is very important for the development of country.

Education plays great role on health. As if the peoples of a country are healthy then they can work hard and good. They can think positively and perform his duty better than any sick person if the peoples of a country are educated then they can take health care and cleanliness. They can take his health care better than an uneducated person by knowing the advantages and disadvantages of that action that they want to done. They never want to do anything which is harmful for his health. And due to this reason they can take health care and can perform better in developing a country.

For the development of a country, the medical field is necessary. One country should have advanced his medical field for the development of a country. Nowadays the ratios of doctor’s are increasing gradually. The doctors can play a great role in developing a country. They can control the health of people of a country. if they work hard then they can invent new ideas and processes of different diseases. If the doctors of a one country are talented and invent new ideas about the health and in medical field they can play a great role in developing a country. The development of a country in medical field are within the doctors hands, if they work hard then they can achieve all the targets that are face nowadays in a country.

The role of religion in the development of a country can plays a great role. The religion has great effects on nations. One country can know him in the world y religion. Actually the nations are building by religions. The religion of one country can united the peoples. They can live in a unity by the religion. The religion and culture plays a great role in a country, they can attract the peoples of other countries and also have effect on non-Muslims. The countries can develop by remaining his cultural and religions relations. Similarly all type of education, the religious education plays a good role in developing a country. Hence we should also take interest in religious education.

It is necessary to familiarize students to the technology and modern living and careers and in the development of country. if the students knows that what and how technology helps in the development of a country and they are thought about the technology then they can make advanced from them and can play a great role because nowadays the student are talented and can achieved the targets. The technology can become country prosperity; they play a huge role in the developing countries.

The one of the most important thing which plays an important role in developing a country is AN ART. The art of one country should develop a country. All subjects like technology, medical and engineering, the arts has its own importance. By arts one country can remain continues his culture and history. Nowadays the nations are developing by arts.

“Art enables us to find ourselves or lose ourselves at the same time.” Arts include many branches which help in developing a country. Mostly they include media, painting, designing and many more which helps much nowadays in developing a country. Like other types of education the art also have some value in developing a country. It is due to arts that the countries lead one another. So we should also give a time to study arts because it plays a great role in developing a country.

In general all levels of education are important but the most important one is tertiary level, which Includes College, university and higher education. In this stage the students have to face many difficulties and learn more about the every field of life. Also within the teen ages a child have sharp mind so they can learn every thing in every field. In other words they can think both positively and negatively and they can show a good result in both field. So here the education plays important role to teach a child that what is right and what is wrong? If they have to teach well means teach positively then they can shows a good result in developing a country. So that’s the reason that tertiary level of education plays an important role in the development of country.

# Role play 1: Are you self taught?

## What Does Self-taught Really Mean?

[https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/mean-self-taught](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/mean-self-taught)

When I was younger I really imagined my guitar heroes as super beings with limitless talent emitting from each fingertip. I had no idea what self-taught meant. I assumed self-taught equaled no guidance or materials at all. Once I was old enough to track down interviews, it turned out that many of my guitar gods learned from books, friends, videos, and other resources. Now, of course it makes sense that people don’t typically learn in a vacuum, but I was a kid, so what did I know.

Self-taught typically meant someone learning without a formal teacher or program, but access to teaching materials was fair game. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines self-taught as, “having knowledge or skills acquired by one’s own efforts without formal instruction.” This seems pretty open-ended to me. It also seems less intimidating to approach a topic if someone can be self-taught and still use a ton of educational resources. Maybe self-educating isn’t so bad if I’m allowed to get a little help.

So where does this leave something such as Treehouse? We certainly provide resources and materials. We even have teachers and tracks to guide you, but is it a formal education? Does it even matter? Is there actually any benefit or detriment to being self-taught?

## Activity: How do you check news nowadays?

### Where do people get their news nowadays?

FUENTE:[paperlit.com/blog/where-do-people-get-their-news-nowadays/](paperlit.com/blog/where-do-people-get-their-news-nowadays/)

For the past few decades, television has been the undisputed leading source of news. In recent years though, a new medium for sourcing news has started to catch up and even surpass television – the Internet.

Even in 2013, statistics from the UK’s Office for National Statistics already showed that 55% of adults, for the first time ever, access news on the web. Social media plays a vital role as well. In 2016, Pew Research revealed that 62% of US adults get their news from social media, with Facebook being the top source.

More mainstream sources of news such as newspapers and TV aren’t gone yet, of course, but the Internet is growing as a prefered source. To help you understand where do people get their news from today, we’re going to concentrate on Internet-based sources, as there’s adequate information on non-Internet sources already.

Below, we will discuss secondary sources, which concentrate on referring visitors to primary news sources. However, that isn’t to say that secondary sources aren’t real news sources in their own right. Let’s take a look:

### Secondary Sources

#### Search engines

Search engines play a vital role in sourcing news on the Internet. For one thing, unless a news reader or viewer know the exact web address of a news website, it’s highly likely that they will use search engines.

Also, if a person wants to see different perspectives on a particular news event, they would usuallyturn to the search engine for other sources. Google perfected news browsing as it intuitively groups news articles that talk about the same topic and it always shows the latest update on a particular news piece rather than rely on SEO on its rankings.

#### Social media

Usually, news websites would use their social media presence as a referral magnet to drive visitors to their websites where the final news piece actually is. Sometimes, it’s enough for social media users to just browse the headlines and short descriptions if they want just a quick overview of the news.

You can feel the role played by social media in recent years. Facebook was at the center of the “fake news” issues, and earlier, Twitter and Youtube have given rise to citizen journalism and even became a catalyst for social and political change such as the Arab Spring.

### Primary Sources

#### Text and video news websites

When the Internet became a popular source of information, news websites became known as “online newspapers” and were the top sources of news for the growing Internet users.

With the increase of Internet users, news websites also became a vital channel for news companies to reach their audience. Its fast growth led to more news companies focusing on their websites. With the addition of other complementary technologies like mobile and social media, news websites increased even more in importance.

Fast forward to today, news websites are still the leading source of news. Regardless of where you first found the news, whether through social media or organic search, at the end of the line, the main destination are still news websites.

#### Digital magazines

While digital magazines have a much lower readership due to many of them being paid subscription-based, nonetheless, they have become a vital source of high-quality news analysis.

Of course, they rarely concentrate on breaking news. Rather, much like their print cousins, they take a more in-depth, analytical approach to news. What separates digital magazines from those above is that it doesn’t necessarily focus on “quick” information, but rather longer articles that provide a deeper understanding of what has been reported in the past.

It doesn’t matter whether they’re focused on geopolitics or economy, such as the Economist, or industry-related news, the value brought by a digital magazine is the same regardless of its focus.

### Conclusion

The Internet has allowed us to multiply our news sources and access them more conveniently. While Internet-based news still exists alongside more mainstream sources such as television and newspapers, the demand for Internet-based news grows stronger than the others. Both publishers and advertisers should discover different ways to incorporate Internet-based content into their strategies to be able to take advantage of this growing opportunity.
