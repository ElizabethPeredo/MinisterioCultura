## Small Talk

### The Purpose of Small Talk:

1.  Conversation initiator:

On the other hand, if it is the conversation between two known individuals, then their chit-chat serves as a pleasing introduction before engaging in other functional topics of conversation. It enables them to sense other’s mood and signal their own mood to develop a strong connection.

3.  During the end of the talk:

A sudden end to a conversation actually results in the risk of rejecting the other person. These chats are useful mitigating the rejection and affirm the relation between two individuals and please the parting.

5.  Space fillers for avoiding the silence:

In most of the cultures, silences between two people are considered uncomfortable. Comfortable can be boosted by initiating phatic talk until a substantial topic occurs. It is because most humans find sometimes silence unbearable.

# Transition: be a chameleon

You have to change the level of formality to fit the situation. And your eyes, even though humans can’t look in more than one direction at once, need to be very observant. If you see certain people doing something in a situation, you need to be able to copy them or mirror what they’re doing to fit in.

## The Overlap

>High self-monitor are like “social chameleons”. They… present different “versions” of themselves, depending on the situation. They blend in.  **(Ronald E. Riggio, PhD, Psychology Today )**
